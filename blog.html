    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10">1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
    <p class="font-semibold mt-5 mx-20 text-xl"> DOM means Document Object Model. DOM is basically a map or model of a web page. It is essentially an API to the page, allowing programs to read and manipulate the content of page, structure, and styles.Every DOM obj. is different and It has its own “properties, events and functionality”. And every DOM obj. has its own Documentation,according to “DOM standard”. There are additional documented functions that can be used to manage an element. These are called the DOM API. <br> <br>
   <span class="font-bold">Puposes:</span>  DOM allow us  to create, change, or remove elements from a website document. DOM manipulation is when you use JavaScript to add, remove, and modify elements of a website. It is very common in web development. </p>
   
   
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10">2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>

   <p class="font-semibold mt-5 mx-20 text-xl">There are 5 ways in which you can select elements in a DOM using selectors. <br>

    <span class="font-bold">getElementsByTagName()</span> -This method is used to select elements based on their tag name. It returns a collection of elements with the specified tag. <br>
    <span class="font-bold" >getElementsByClassName()</span> - This method is used to select elements based on their class name. It returns a collection of elements with the specified class.<br>
    <span class="font-bold">getElementById()</span> - This method is used to select an element based on its unique ID attribute. It returns the element with the specified ID.<br>
    <span class="font-bold">querySelector()</span> - This method is used to select all elements that match a CSS selector. It returns a collection of elements that match the selector.<br>
    <span class="font-bold">querySelectorAll()</span> - This method is used to select all elements that match a CSS selector. It returns a collection of elements that match the selector.</p> <br>
<br>
<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10"> 3. What is event bubble?</h1> 
<p class="font-semibold mt-5 mx-20 text-xl">The Events in JavaScript are a change in the state of an object. There are a bunch of events where some activity is performed by the user or browser. When the JavaScript code is included in the HTML, JavaScript will react to the events. This process of reacting to events is known as Event handling. Event bubbling is a way of event propagation in the HTML DOM. It relates to the order in which events are propagated in nested elements.
    In bubbling, when an event happens, the handler of the innermost element runs, then the parents, and then the further ancestor elements. In other words, events bubble up or propagate the DOM tree upwards.</p>
    
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-10">4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
    <p class="font-semibold mt-5 mx-20 text-xl mb-5">A callback function in javascript is a function that is passed as an argument in another function. Which is then called inside the parent function to complete a routine or an action. To put it more simply, it is a function that will be called(executed) later after its parent function(the function in which it is passed as an argument) is done executing. <br>
        Callbacks are important for anyone using server-based technology to provide real-time reporting for mobile marketing analysis and on-the-dime optimizations. They are crucial for providing data to tools or dashboards connected to or integrated with the server.</p>
